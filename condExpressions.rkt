;; The code above looks like well formed, but in fact are wrong.
;; The second conditional IF are inside the first IF, this meaning that
;; The second conditional will only be use IF the first result are false,
;; and that isnÂ´t the correct stub and template. So I correct the code and
;; put him below.
;; In other words, the condicional in the code above is what we call multi-armed
;; conditional. I add also the Else conditional, so if none of the previous questions
;; were true, ''do this'', in this case is answer ''wide''.
